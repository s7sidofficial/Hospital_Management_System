# Hospital Management System

# Description
Our goal in this project is to address the conventional problems in hospital administration.  The primary problems included improper data handling, time wastage during storage and retrieval, patients' incapacity to comprehend the prescription, etc. By giving physicians and other staff members individual user accounts, these problems are resolved. separating the data for each patient and tracking past visits with a simple click.

This project offers advantages like platform independence, high performance, and security because it is written in Java and uses MySQL as the backend. The web application primarily makes use of the Hibernate and SpringMVC frameworks.

It offers a few upgraded capabilities, like a simple interface for adding and removing staff members and PDF prescriptions. Consequently, the doctor will not need to write and sign as much.
